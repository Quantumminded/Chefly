        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Zero Planning, Maximum Impact</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most transformative benefit of hiring a private chef is liberation from planning. Rather than researching restaurants, navigating reservations, enduring crowds, and managing logistics, your chef handles everything. You simply articulate your preferences—and they orchestrate an experience.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This is especially valuable for villa guests on Lake Como. While others spend vacation time scouting restaurants and coordinating transportation, you're enjoying aperitivos on a terrace, fully present with your guests, knowing that dinner—perfectly tailored to your preferences—awaits.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Radical Personalization</h2>
        <p>
          Private chefs craft menus specifically around your palate, dietary requirements, and preferences. Want a seafood-focused tasting menu honoring your love of Italian classics? Done. Require vegan accommodations that are artistically presented and genuinely exciting? Your chef specializes in this. Allergies to specific ingredients? They're factored into every dish from the outset.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This level of personalization is impossible in restaurant settings. Every dish, every course, every wine pairing reflects understanding of your preferences. It's dining designed around you, not around standardized menus.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Michelin-Quality Cuisine at Home</h2>
        <p>
          You don't compromise on culinary excellence by dining privately. Your chef has trained in Michelin-starred brigades across Europe, mastering precision plating, complex flavor architecture, and innovative techniques. Yet they deliver this expertise in your villa, where dining is intimate, private, and entirely personalized.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The technical precision—temperature control, timing, plate composition—rivals fine dining restaurants. The difference: no crowds, no reservations pressure, no time constraints. You dine at your pace, in your space, with your people.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Flexibility & Spontaneity</h2>
        <p>
          Plans change. Guests arrive early or late. Someone craves seafood instead of the planned vegetarian course. Your private chef adapts seamlessly. This responsiveness—adjusting menus mid-week, accommodating last-minute guest arrivals, pivoting to different cuisines—is impossible with restaurants but fundamental with private chefs.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Your vacation remains your own. You're not locked into restaurant opening hours, fixed seating times, or predetermined menu structures. Dinner is whenever you want it, however you want it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Impeccable Service & Ambiance Control</h2>
        <p>
          Private chefs coordinate service staff who understand luxury hospitality. Unlike restaurants where service is standardized, your private service is choreographed around your preferences and pace. Some guests prefer attentive, formal service; others want casual, friendly interaction. Your team adapts.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Ambiance is entirely your creation: candlelight, music, dress code, table layout, conversational tone. There's no external noise, no strangers at neighboring tables, no interruptions to your evening's flow.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Privacy & Security</h2>
        <p>
          For discerning travelers—executives, celebrities, high-net-worth individuals—privacy is paramount. Private dining eliminates public visibility while maintaining the luxury and sophistication expected. Your meal happens entirely within your villa's private space, with trusted professionals under secure arrangements including NDAs.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-white mb-4">Investment in Memories</h2>
        <p>
          A private chef experience becomes the highlight of your villa stay—the moment you gather and remember for years. Corporate clients use private chefs for business development because meals create relationships. Families celebrate milestones with dinners that become treasured traditions. Romantic partners mark anniversaries with experiences that deepen connection.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This intangible value—the memories, the connection, the experience—transcends any price. You're not just eating; you're creating moments.
